<!-- 1. Question number one -->
<!-- Local Storage and Session Storage defference -->

sessionStorage is similar to localStorage ;
the difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't expire,
data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends.
Whenever a document is loaded in a particular tab in the browser,
a unique page session gets created and assigned to that particular tab.
