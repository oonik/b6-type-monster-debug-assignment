<!-- 1. Question number one -->
<!-- Local Storage and Session Storage defference -->

sessionStorage is similar to localStorage ;
the difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't expire,
data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends.
Whenever a document is loaded in a particular tab in the browser,
a unique page session gets created and assigned to that particular tab.

<!-- 2. Question number tow -->
<!-- global scope and block scope defference -->

<!-- global scope -->
The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global variables and have global scope.
Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that program, any function or conditional state
can access that variable.

<!-- block scope -->
Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope of the variables inside the
curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or conditional statements, or something else. You are only
allowed to refer to these variables from within the curly brackets {}.
